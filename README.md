<br>The Bathroom App is created for the users who are on the go. Have you ever been in a foreign city and really need to use the bathrooom and, of course, time is of the essence so you can't wander around looking for the bathroom? Well this app is created for you! Click on the address and be able to find that bathroom on the App!

# Planning

The planning began with a request-response cycle of the App I wanted to create. Once I was able to visualize the cycle I created a wireframe. The wireframe showed the routes that I needed and where I could implement them.

Bronze - MVP, Full working CRUD<br>
Silver - Adding a functional third party API<br>
Gold - Users having the ability to search from current location and find themselves on the map with existing bathrooms around them


# Technologies Used
Express, Bootstrap, CSS, Node

# Dependencies
Method-Override, Body-Parser, Express, Handlebars, Mongodb

# App Improvements

There are a few things I would like to change about the app in the future to make it more functional for the user -
- Allowing the user to begin the search by entering in their own location
- seperating user entered bathrooms by state or zipcode
- More CSS or Bootstrap styling
