Have you ever been in a foreign city and really need to use the bathrooom and, of course, time is of the essence so you can't wander around looking for the bathroom? Well this app is created for you! Click on the address and be able to find that bathroom on the App!

# App Improvements

There are a few things I would like to change about the app in the future to make it more functional for the user -
- Allowing the user to begin the search by entering in their own location
- seperating user entered bathrooms by state or zipcode
- More CSS or Bootstrap styling
